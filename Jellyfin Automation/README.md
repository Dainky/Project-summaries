# ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin + Usenet Automation Stack

Jellyfin came soon after my Nextcloud project. While Jellyfin wasnâ€™t as much of a necessity as Nextcloud, I thought it was a cool concept â€” having a personal Netflix with **anything I wanted**, accessible **anywhere in the world**. I mean, thatâ€™s kinda cool, yeah?

Actually, with the number of streaming services these days, you could argue itâ€™s almost a necessity. One month *The Office* is on Netflix, the next itâ€™s on Paramount+, then itâ€™s on HBO. Maybe cable wasnâ€™t all that bad after all.

### ðŸ§  Background

The main issue with Jellyfin was that you had to **manually install every movie**, name it properly, and move it to the right folder. Like I mentioned in the previous log, I had found and even set up some basic automation tasks using **Radarr** and **Prowlarr**, but they were hosted on my main Windows machine.

That meant every time I downloaded a movie, I had to **transfer it via SCP** to the server â€” which took forever. On top of that, I forgot the login password for both Radarr and Prowlarr (lol), though you can disable authentication in the config if needed.

So, the easy solution: move the **entire stack directly to the server**, polish it up, and integrate everything under one automated workflow.  
And thatâ€™s exactly what I did.

**Step 1:** Create a new container stack for Radarr and SABnzbd using Docker. These will handle all our movie automation and downloads.

**Step 2:** Pull the Radarr and SABnzbd images â€” our new containers are created inside the stack.

---

**Step 3:** Update a few network rules to make sure the containers can communicate properly within the stack.

---

**Step 4:** SABnzbd is installed and accessible via the web UI. The downloader portion of the workflow is now ready.

---

**Step 5:** Inside Radarrâ€™s web interface, we point **Prowlarr** to Radarr as its indexer manager.  
This links movie searches to the indexers we configure later.

*Added post-project but belongs here in the workflow:*  
A separate **Sonarr** instance was configured specifically for anime to avoid naming conflicts and library mix-ups, since anime tends to use different naming schemes.

---

![Screenshot_5.2](Photos/Screenshot_5.2.png)
*Also post-project:*  
A second **Sonarr** instance was added for general TV series like *The Office*, *Game of Thrones*, and *Dexter*.  
Currently, this library is empty â€” mostly because I prefer movies and anime (and Iâ€™ve already seen most of the good shows).

**Step 6:** Prowlarr is linked to our chosen **indexer (hidden out of respect)** â€” this is where it fetches the actual NZB data.

---

**Step 7:** Time to configure our download client â€” **SABnzbd** â€” so it can fetch data from the indexers and store files in the correct directories.

---

**Step 8:** SABnzbd is configured and connected to Radarr and Sonarr. Everythingâ€™s now automated from search to download.

---

**Step 9:** Test run: *Barnyard* was requested through Radarr â†’ Prowlarr queried the indexer â†’ found the file â†’ passed it to SABnzbd â†’ download complete.

---

**Step 10:** After the download, Radarr recognizes the movie, renames it, and applies the correct metadata format for Jellyfin.

---

![Screenshot_10](Photos/Screenshot_10.png)
**Step 11:** Radarr imports the completed movie into our **new 4TB HDD**, where it will live permanently and be served to Jellyfin.

---

![Screenshot_11](Photos/Screenshot_11.png)
âœ… **Success:** The movie is now watchable through Jellyfin â€” both locally and remotely. The entire automated workflow works flawlessly.

---

**Step 12:** Drive overview â€” our 4TB HDD for movies, a 500GB SSD for the OS, and an old 2TB drive salvaged from another PC.

---

![Screenshot_13](Photos/Screenshot_13.png)
**Step 13:** Tried formatting the 2TB drive, but it vanished mid-format. After some troubleshooting, it turned out to be fried. RIP â€” couldâ€™ve held another 50 movies. ðŸ˜­

**Step 14:** Final Docker stack lineup:  
> **Prowlarr**, **Radarr**, **SABnzbd**, **Sonarr**, and **Sonarr-Anime**

---

![Screenshot_15](Photos/Screenshot_15.png)
**Step 15:** A few days later â€” all containers are still running strong, no hiccups.

---

![Screenshot_16](Photos/Screenshot_16.png)
**Step 16:** Updated Jellyfin interface with new **TV Shows**, **Anime**, and **Movies** folders.  
Also added custom CSS from the gorgeous [Ultrachromic theme](https://github.com/CTalvio/Ultrachromic) by CTalvio.

### ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

While it isn't baked into the screenshots as much as Iâ€™d like, this entire stack is powered by **Usenet**, which costs around **$12/month** for access to the download servers.  
This can all be done using torrents for free â€” but trust me, **Usenet is insanely faster**.  
I can download a **40GB movie in 10 minutes** on a 1 Gbps connection. A torrent? Thatâ€™d take an hour or more.

This setup turned what used to be a semi-practical workflow (manual downloads, naming, and transfers) into a **fully automated media pipeline**. Now, all I need to do is **search for a movie**, hit **add**, and it appears in my Jellyfin library minutes later â€” metadata, cover art, and all.

The only real limit now? **Storage.**  
Did I fill a 4TB drive in two days? Maybe.  
Do I have a new storage addiction? Maybe. ðŸ˜…  

Weâ€™ve been using this setup over Halloween, and itâ€™s been incredible. Last night we watched *The Wailing* â€” requested it in Radarr, the **40GB Remux version** downloaded in 10 minutes flat.  
Great movie, by the way.
